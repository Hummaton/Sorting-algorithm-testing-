# Sorting-algorithm-testing-
In this program several sorting algorithms will be tested. They will be tasked with sorting an increasing list of numbers and the time it takes for the sorting to occur will be tracked and displayed on a table.
Selectionsort has been disabled but can be reenabled by removing the commented Selectionsort function in the java program
